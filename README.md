# Digit-Classification-Using-Logistic-Regression

## Description

The data set used is a subset of the MNIST data and contains the digits 4 & 9.
The images are stored as column vectors and labels are included.
For classification, I have implemented Newton’s method (a.k.a. Newton-Raphson) to find a minimizer of the L2 regularized negative log likelihood J(θ) = −l(θ) + λ||θ||^2
